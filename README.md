# Packing List App

A simple React app for managing your travel packing checklist that I worked on as part of the "Ultimate React" course by Jonas Schmedtmann. Add, toggle, and remove items as you plan your trips.

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Add new items with descriptions and quantities
* 🧳 Mark items as packed/unpacked
* 🔄 Sort by input order, description, or packed status
* ❌ Remove individual items or clear the whole list

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js >= 14.x
* npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TamsinLloyd99/Packing-list.git
cd Packing-list
npm install
```

### Run the App

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

1. Type an item description and quantity, then click **Add**
2. Toggle an item by clicking on it — it will be marked packed/unpacked
3. Use the **dropdown** to change sorting order
4. Click the **Delete** icon to remove an item
5. Use **Clear List** to reset the entire list
